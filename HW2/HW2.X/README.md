### HW2: Interfacing DAC over SPI.
<br>
This code deals with generating a 2hz sine wave and 1Hz triangle wave.<br>
Both the waves oscillate between 0 & 3.3V.<br>
The data is sent over SPI to the DAC module. We connect the DAC module output to the n-Scope the view the results.<br>

The results of the above code can be seen below:<br>
